    "Content": "Game rules\\n\\nHow to play\\nYour goal is to remove all cards from the playing area./nOn the lower end of the screen you can see a\\nface-up card(the \"pile\") and several overlapping\\nface-down cards(the \"talon\"). All all cards above\\nthese are in the \"playing area\".\\n\\n\\nTap and card in the playing area that is one higher\\nor one lower than the card visible on the pile.\\nFollowing in this order or\\nreverse:...5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10\\n-J-Q-K-A... and so on.\\n\\n\\nIf there is no card to play, tap the talon to get a new\\n card on the pile. Check again to see if there is a\\ncard in the playing area one higher or one lower\\nthan the card on the pile. if yes, tap the card. If no,\\ntap the talon again. Move all cards from the playing\\narea to the pile to win.\\n\\n\\nIf you run out of cards in the talon before moving\\nall cards in the play area to the pile, you lose the\\ngame. If so, a \"+5 cards\" and an \"End game\"\\nbutton will appear. You can get 5 additional cards\\nand try to finish the level or tap \"End game\" to retry\\nor go back to the map.\\n\\n\\nStar rating\\nOnce you have mastered a level, your playing\\nskills are rated: 3 stars - incredible, 2 stars - very good, 1 star - ok.\\n\\nTo achieve a higher star rating, concentrate on two factors: 1) The more cards remain in tge talon the better 2) The longer the streaks the better.\\n\\nIn case you have troubles improving your star\\nrating, try using Wild card!\\n\\nWild card\\nThe Wild caard substitutes for all cards. This means\\nif there is a Wild card on the pile, you can play any\\ncard from the playing area! If you have problems\\nfinishing a level or challenge, try using a Wild card!\\n It's also very convenient to extend streaks! The\\nWild card also does not count as a turn on the\\nBomb counter (see \"The Bomb\" below)!\\n\\n\\nUndo\\nIf you miss playing a playable card, the card will\\nanimate. Tap Undo to try again. You can then play\\nthe card you have missed.\\n\\n\\nThe Purple +X card\\nThese purple cards display a number in an \"+X\"\\nformat. If you uncover such a card, you will get the\\nNumber shown on the card as free additional cards\\nin the talon. Very convenient!\\n\\n\\nThe Value-Changer Card\\nA \"Value-changer\" card changes its value with\\neach turn. The up-arrows show that the value gets\\nincreased, e.g. an 8 becomes a 9 in the next turn.\\nDown-arrows show that the value gets decreased,\\ne.g. a 4 becomes a 3 in the next turn. the color\\nand suit stay the same!\\nPlease note: Legend has it that some\\n Value-changers change suit or color. Maybe you\\ncan uncover these during your journey.\\n\\n\\nThe Bomb\\nA bomb is attached to a card. play this card to\\nremove the bomb.\\nThe bomb shows a counter. This counter is\\ndecreased by 1 each turn. You lose the game if the\\n counter reaches zero. BOOOM!\\nPlease note: If you have problems removing the\\nbomb use a Wild card!\\n\\n\\nDaily Bonus\\nYou can collect the Daily Bonus once every day. It\\nwill be increased after you have unlocked several\\n crops.\\nHarvesting Free Credits\\nYou can harvest your fields every hour. Do this to\\nget free credits! Dont't worry, the beautiful crops will\\n fully grow again within 60 minutes of your last\\nharvest, so you can really enjoy looking at your\\nprogress. The more fields/crops you have\\nunlocked, the more credits you will receive.\\nFacebook and Invites\\nPlease log in to Facebook to back up your\\nprogress and to invite friends. You will get credits\\nfor logging in to Facebook the first time (only the first time).\\n\\nIf you invite Friends, you can get a lot of free\\n credits. Here is how to:\\n- First, you have to log into Facebook.\\n- Then, use the Facebook Button on the main map\\nto bring up the invite pop-up. Confirm it. Then invite\\nyour friends in the next pop-up(s).\\n\\nYou will get free credits for each invited friend that\\na) installs tha app and b) also logs into Facebook\\nwith his/her account. Both steps have to be done!\\nPlease note that you do not get credits if the friend\\nalready has the app and was already logged in to\\nFacebook prior to you invite.\\nTell your Friends\\nYou get free credits for telling your friends about\\nthis game.
